    <p><h2>About NaatieOdd</h2><br>

    Welcome! I'm NaatieOdd, a tech enthusiast and gamer from the Netherlands. My passion for technology led me to explore programming as a hobby, and I've enjoyed the journey ever since.
    <br><br>

    If you're into Minecraft's Lord of the Rings mods, you might recognize me from servers like History of Middle Earth and Ainulindale, where I've been an active member of the community. These servers have allowed me to dive deep into the worlds I love, combining my interest in fantasy with my enjoyment of gaming.
    <br><br>

    One of the things I love most is playing alongside other fans of Lord of the Rings. There’s something special about connecting with people who share a passion for these epic stories.
    <br><br>

    I'm particularly proud of this website—my first major project. It’s been a rewarding experience to see it come together, and I have big plans for the future.
    <br><br>

    Beyond the screen, I'm a fan of all things fantasy, from the intricate stories of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones to the thrill of motorsports. Gaming, programming, and building virtual worlds are just a few of the ways I express my creativity.
    And if you want to know me on a more spiritual level. I am a follower of Jesus Christ And wouldn't be against talking about my belief.
    <br><br>

    And yes, it's really me—NaatieOdd. Stick around, because there's much more to come!</p><br>
